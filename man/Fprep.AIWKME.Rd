\title{Cox proportional hazards model for eta-free terms in the (S)AIWKME estimator.}
\usage{
Fprep.AIWKME(datalist, t0)
}
\arguments{
\item{datalist}{A list used to calculate the (S)AIWKME estimator including treatment named \code{a}, observed time named \code{obs.t}, censoring indicator (0, censored) named \code{delta}, and baseline covariates used to assign treatment named \code{l}.}

\item{t0}{A predetermined t.}
}
\value{
A list including the augmented terms in the numerator with treatment all to 1 named \code{gamma.num.1} and all to 0 named \code{gamma.num.0} and in the denominator with treatment all to 1 named \code{gamma.den.1} and all to 0 named \code{gamma.den.0}; \code{gamma.num.1} and the others are matrix with ordered observed time as rows and patients as columns. More details can be found in references.
